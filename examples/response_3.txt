Inhibiting Inorganic Fouling on Reverse Osmosis Membranes by Surface Modification

[[Technical Summary of Work]]

Graphene oxide (GO), a well-known antimicrobial material, coatings on membranes can improve antifouling performance against a variety of microorganisms and organics. However, the effects of GO coatings on mineral scaling were not investigated. In this study, we first coated a commercially available reverse osmosis (RO) membrane with GO and proved the coating with different characterization techniques. We showed that by coating the bare membrane with GO, transport properties of the membrane like water permeability and salt rejection did not decrease while surface properties like hydrophilicity, measured by water contact angle method, and charge, measured by zeta potential, changed in favor of less fouling.

Second, we investigated the gypsum scaling on bare and GO-modified thin-film polyamide membranes followed by cleaning with deionized (DI) water with a bench-scale reverse osmosis setup. We observed that flux decline caused by gypsum scaling on GO coated membrane was slightly reduced than on bare membrane. This is because the GO coated membrane is more hydrophilic than bare membrane, indicating a higher energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation and/or the deposition of gypsum on it. Moreover, the more negatively charged GO coated membrane lead to stronger electrostatic repulsive forces between the membrane and the negatively charged gypsum particles and thus further inhibiting gypsum deposition onto membranes. We characterized the precipitates formed on both membranes. The results showed that GO coating does not affect the type of precipitation.

Interestingly, during the cleaning process, we observed smaller flux recovery for GO coated membrane. This is because GO coated surfaces have higher densities of carboxyl (–COOH) groups, which form complexes with Ca2+, building strong bonds between GO coatings and gypsum. Our study provided unique insights on the physicochemical interactions among membrane, the scaling mineral, and aqueous species, which can help the rational design of coatings for better simultaneous anti-scaling and antifouling performances.

[[Plain Language Summary of Work]]

Desalination is one of the most promising technologies to provide an infinite, uninterruptable, and reliable source of clean water, by converting salty water to fresh water. Today, membrane separation via reverse osmosis (RO) accounts for over 50% of the installed capacity in the world. In the past two decades, large-scale RO desalination has advanced significantly, mainly because of the development of more robust thin-film composite polyamide membranes, but such membranes still suffer from fouling. Membrane fouling by inorganic materials (scaling) and microorganisms (biofouling) have been the subject of many studies since membrane fouling will decrease clean water production levels, increase energy consumption due to clogging of the membrane pores, and potentially damage equipment. Coating RO membranes with different materials is one approach to reduce fouling, but most studies have focused on the effect of a coating on either biofouling or scaling. We believe the simultaneous prevention of mineral scaling and biofouling on RO membranes can give a boost to RO expansion worldwide.

In this study, we used graphene oxide (GO) coating on an RO membrane. GO coating is known to reduce biofouling, but its effect on scaling has not studied. We used a bench-scale RO system to test the performance of GO coated membrane and compare it with a commercially available non-coated membrane. We used salty waters with different amount of salts to investigate different conditions since the amount of salt in seawater or brackish water is not the same worldwide. First of all we observed that although we add a layer of GO to the membrane the amount of clean water that can pass through the GO coated membrane is the same as membrane without coating. Second, we used different kind of salty waters as feed to the RO system. We observed that membrane coated with GO has less scaling thus more clean water production compared to the membrane without coating. However, removing scales formed on the membrane was harder for GO coated membrane compared to the membrane without coating.

[[Summary of the Significance of the Work]]

- This project is important to my field because we believe a new approach for enhancing the reverse osmosis desalination is required, by dealing with biofouling and scaling at the same time. Most, if not all, studies on using surface modification for decreasing fouling on RO membranes focus on either biofouling or scaling. However, it is possible a surface modification which decreases the scaling increases the biofouling or vice versa, but researchers do not investigate that. We believe in order to achieve this goal, first we must understand the complex physical- chemical-biological interactions in the RO systems. By doing that we might be able to provide coatings that can reduce both biofouling and scaling.

- This project is important to the United States because technological breakthroughs have led to desalination expansion in the US in recent years. More than 300 municipal-level seawater and brackish water desalination plants with the ability to produce at least 25,000 gallons of potable water per day exist in the United States, with countless projects in the pipeline. Florida takes the lead for municipal desalination by volume, with 282 million gallons of potable water produced per day from both ocean and brackish water treatment, according to the South Florida Water Management District. Ranking second in the country is California: the state’s Department of Water Resources reported that 140,189 acre-feet per year or 125 million gallons per day were treated in 2013. The Claude "Bud" Lewis Carlsbad Desalination Plant, the largest in the United States, was completed in 2015 and can produce up to 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. Municipal desalination plants in Texas can produce about 142 million gallons per day, according to the Texas Water Board, all from brackish groundwater and surface water treatment (there are, as of yet, no municipal seawater desalination plants in Texas). We believe our finding can pave the way for faster expansion of RO desalination in the US.

- This project is related to my proposed endeavor because we discovered a new approach to desalination that I am building on in my current devising of new methods for inhibiting fouling in the reverse osmosis membrane desalination strategy. This is one piece of that puzzle.
