Removing Pollutants, Dyes, and Heavy Metal Components from Industrial Wastewater Using Nanocomposites

[[Technical Summary of Work]]

We synthesized two sets of novel nanoparticles:

1) To remove Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methylene Blue (MB) from water by adsorption. The nanoparticles were: a) Fe3O4 coated with β-cyclodextrin (Fe@CD), b) Fe3O4 coated with β- cyclodextrin-succinic anhydride (Fe@CDA1), and c) Fe3O4 coated with β-cyclodextrin-Epiclon (Fe@CDA2).

2) To remove heavy metal ions, cadmium (Cd2+) and copper (Cu2+) from water by adsorption. The nanoparticles were: a) Fe3O4 coated with hydroxyapatite (Fe3O4@HA) and b) Fe3O4 coated with hydroxyapatite and β-cyclodextrin (Fe3O4@HA-CD).

For heavy metal removal Fe3O4@HA and Fe3O4@HA-CD were faster than dye removal as adsorption reached equilibrium in 60 min for removing Cd2+ and Cu2+. Fe3O4@HA-CD had higher adsorption than Fe3O4@HA for Cd2+ and Cu2+ as a result we chose Fe3O4@HA-CD for the rest of experiments.

We investigated the effect of pH on adsorption and based on that we suggested two mechanisms for dye adsorption: i) electrostatic attraction and ii) host-guest inclusion complex formation. For RhB most likely the first mechanism is dominant i.e. negative sites of the adsorbent at high pH attract positively charged dye molecules. However, for MB the dominant mechanism can be the entrance of dye molecule into the βCD cavity and inclusion complex formation as by lowering the pH of solution.

We investigate the effect of the amount of adsorbents on the removal of the pollutants. For dyes, Fe@CDA2 was able to remove 80% of RhB and 96% of MB. For heavy metals, Fe3O4@HA- CD were able to remove 100% of Cd2+ and 80% of Cu2+.

We investigate the isotherms governing the adsorption for pollutants. For all the pollutants, adsorption was following the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity predicted by Langmuir isotherm was 333.3 mg/g for RhB, which is higher than many other similar studies presented in our paper (Vahedi et al.), 250 mg/g for MB, 100 mg/g for Cd2+, which is higher than many other similar studies presented in our paper (Bardi et al.), and 66.66 mg/g for Cu2+ which is higher than many other similar studies presented in our paper (Bardi et al.).

We investigate the reusability of the adsorbents by desorbing the pollutants. After 5 cycles, Fe@CDA2 lost ~ 10% of its adsorption capacity and Fe3O4@HA-CD lost ~ 20% of its adsorption capacity. We characterized the adsorbents after 5 cycles, the results that the structure of the adsorbents have not changed. Based on the reusability and stability of the adsorbents we concluded these adsorbents can be used for a long term to remove pollutants from water.

[[Plain Language Summary of Work]]

In order to remove some pollutants like dye (rhodamine B and methylene blue) and heavy metal (cadmium and copper ions), which can be harmful for the environment, from industrial wastewater we made two series of particles with magnetic properties. The idea is to add these particles to the wastewater, give them some time to attach to the pollutants and then remove the particles and pollutants from water by an external magnet. Fe3O4 is a magnetic material but it does not have enough sites on its surface to attach to pollutants. In order to provide more sites on the Fe3O4, we modified Fe3O4 by coating it with some polymers. The polymer coating provides more sites for pollutant attachment and is thin enough to not reduce the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 significantly i.e. the coated particles still can be removed from the water by external magnet.

At the best condition, we were able to remove 80% of rhodamine B, 96% of methylene blue, 100% of cadmium ions, and 80% of copper ions. The amount of the attached pollutant for each gram of the particles, known as capacity which is an important parameter to evaluate the performance of a particle, was pretty high compared to many similar studies especially for methylene blue, cadmium ions, and copper ions.

We also investigate if we can reuse these particles to remove pollutants over several cycles. In order to reuse the particles, first we have to remove the attached pollutants from the particles. We have tested different solutions to find the best solution to remove the pollutants. After that we used those solutions to remove the pollutants, we reused the particles to attach to the pollutants. We have tried this process 5 times. After 5 times, the particles that were used to attach the dyes lost only 10% of its capacity and the particles that were used to attach the heavy metals lost less than 20% of its capacity. All the particles keep their structure and there was no deformation. These results show that these particles can be used for pollutant removal from industrial wastewater for a long period of time

[[Summary of the Significance of the Work]]

- This project is important to my field because many industrial wastewaters contain dyes like textile, leather, cosmetics, paper and plastics and many contain heavy metals like textile, metal plating, pesticides production, oil refining, battery production, and mining. The release of these pollutants can significantly harm the environment. For instance, rhodamine B is a toxic carcinogenic dye which causes reproductive toxicity and neurotoxicity in humans and animals. Methylene blue may permanently injure the eyes of humans and animals. It may also cause breathing difficulties upon inhalation. Heavy metals are toxic, carcinogenic, non-biodegradable, and tend to accumulate in living organisms. Cadmium is highly toxic and mobile and copper may cause vomiting, gastrointestinal sickness, or even death.
Among different methods available to remove dyes and heavy metals from water, adsorption is a low-cost method and is a procedure of choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness in removing different types of dyes and heavy metals. An adsorbent should have high removal rate and high adsorption capacity. Moreover, it should be easily removed from water. In this project, we made different adsorbents that can practically be used to remove dyes and heavy metals.

- This project is important to the United States because , as mentioned above, the nanoparticles we synthesized can be used to remove dyes and heavy metals from the wastewater of different industries. For example, we can take a closer look at textile industry which has both dyes and heavy metals in its wastewater. According to National Council of Textile Organization (NCTO) website, the U.S. textile industry supply chain employed 594,147 workers in 2018. U.S. textile and apparel shipments totaled $76.8 billion in 2018. U.S. textile mills have increased labor productivity by 60% since 2000. The U.S. textile industry invested $22.8 billion in new plants and equipment from 2006 to 2017. On the other hand, the textile plants produce wastewater containing different pollutants including dyes and heavy metals. As fresh water becomes scarcer in the U.S., the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has put pressure on the industries to clean their wastewater. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the main document determining the allowable amount of different pollutants in the industrial wastewater which will be discharged to the environment. The EPA regulations become stricter over time. In order to follow the regulation, textile plants can benefit from our project to clean up their wastewater efficiently and with less expense. These regulations set by the EPA were one of the reasons that some dye manufacturers left the business in the 1976-1988 period. Sodyeco (now part of Clariant) had to install a $ 1.5 million wastewater treatment plant to purify water discharged into the Catawba river in South Carolina. However, our method stands to be a much cheaper and more effective alternative, which benefits industries looking for ways to meet EPA standards in wastewater treatment without investing large amounts of money.

- This project is related to my proposed endeavor because they both are efforts to improve wastewater treatment using nanoparticles. My current work builds directly atop this past work.
