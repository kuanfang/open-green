For my proposed endeavor, I intend to continue my research on wastewater treatment and bioremediation strategies with the goal of improving existing decontamination methods. I also plan on continuing my research on developing novel desalination techniques with the goal of improving access to drinkable water in areas where water scarcity is a significant issue. I believe I will be able to accomplish these research goals over the course of my current and future employment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston, where I am currently completing my Ph.D. and where I have been offered a permanent research position upon the completion of my degree. My supervisor is willing to sign a letter confirming their intent to hire me once I have completed my Ph.D. studies.
